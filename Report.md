# Report

The segment detection system was implemented based on the necessity of the 3x3 pixel matrix as the ideal window size to accurately capture fundamental line segments and corners; this selection is the most efficient dimension to define all eight possible neighbor relationships without introducing unnecessary computational overhead. The detection mechanism operates by iterating across the entire canvas image and printing all non-empty $3 \times 3$ windows to the console for assessment, thereby satisfying Goals 1 and 2. For Milestone 2, the algorithm filters this data by comparing each window against six predefined ideal binary patterns (including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, an L-shape, and a single point). Successful matches are stored, and their location is visually confirmed in the paintEvent by drawing a purple-colored verification rectangle centered on the detected segment, demonstrating the correct functionality of the implemented filters.
